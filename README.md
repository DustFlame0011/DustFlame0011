# 🥑 Hi, I'm DustFlame

I recently completed a **Full-Stack Development Bootcamp**, gaining hands-on experience in building modern web applications with a focus on both frontend and backend development.

My technical foundation includes working with **React.js, TypeScript, Node.js, RESTful APIs, and SQL databases**, along with applying best practices in application structure, authentication, and data handling. I am especially interested in building clean, maintainable systems that connect thoughtful UI with reliable backend logic.

While I bring prior professional experience from international and cross-functional environments, I am now fully focused on starting my career as a **Junior Full-Stack / Backend Developer**, continuously learning and improving through real-world projects.

## 🧪 Backend Knowledge & Experience (Completed)

I have completed backend-focused training and hands-on practice covering:

* **RESTful API development** using Node.js
* **Authentication & Authorization** (JWT-based login, protected routes, role-based access)
* **Database design & CRUD operations** with SQL and NoSQL databases
* **Input validation & error handling** for stable and secure APIs
* **Basic backend security practices** (password hashing, access control)
* **API integration with frontend applications**

I am comfortable explaining backend flows such as:

```
Client → API → Service / Logic → Database → Response
```

## 📚 Full-Stack Learning & Practice

Through a structured Full-Stack learning path, I have worked on:

* Advanced **JavaScript & TypeScript** concepts
* **React.js** and frontend architecture
* **Node.js backend development** and REST APIs
* **Database integration** (Appwrite, MongoDB, SQL)
* Small-to-medium **full-stack projects** connecting frontend and backend

> 🎯 Goal: Become a **Frontend / Full-Stack Developer** with strong UI/UX sensibilities and solid backend fundamentals.
